# Makefile.compat.targ: defines targets used for setting up and running the Fast
# library compatibility tests.
#

#
# We normally despise monolithic targets that do a bunch of work like this.
# It's typically much better to have them depend on intermediate targets that do
# the real work so that the target is interruptible, incremental, and
# parallelizable.  In this case, the main output is the local copy of the
# node-fast module, but the presence of that module does not mean it was
# successfully installed.
